# Attention_2D_Unet
A customized 2D U-net implemented using attention module to emphasize on important channel and spatial information.
The attention Module used in this implementation inspired by https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06521

The attention module imitates the dorsal (where) and ventral (what) streams of attention mechanism.

The attention module mized with residual concept to obtain better result.
